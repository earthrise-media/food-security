# INSIGHTS FOR A MORE RESILIENT FOOD SYSTEM

## THE FOOD SYSTEM AFFECTS OUR CLIMATE.

Intro video

The food system accounts for more than a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2021 study in Nature Food. What’s worse, emissions from food are projected to increase by at least 50% by 2050.

## OUR CLIMATE AFFECTS OUR FOOD.
### Climate chaos is disrupting the global food system. 
A rapidly changing environment is creating future scenarios with worsening food security and hunger, while natural disasters are upending food supply chains right this minute.

---
## BUT HOW?
### The problem is dynamic and multifaceted. 
Key stakeholders involved in the food system aren’t sure how to take decisive action on this problem, in part, because they lack reliable data tools needed to inform decision-making.

## About this project

We envision a more sustainable and equitable food system — a food system rooted in data and designed to be resilient in the face of climate change.

We’re building a collaborative platform to provide innovative thinkers with data-based insights at the intersection of climate change and food — starting with food insecurity in Pakistan.

We see this becoming a sort of open innovation platform and resource hub, a place to engage with the data and with each other.

# Pakistan
## EARLY INVESTIGATION: DEVELOPING INSIGHTS ON FOOD SECURITY

Pakistan’s food security has evolved. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

Floods and landslides devastated Pakistan in 2022, resulting in millions of people without access to food or safe drinking water.

Over 75% of the wheat going to Pakistan comes from Russia or Ukraine.

## What We’re Learning + Exploring
### WIP: More questions?

The global food system is affected by droughts and floods, heat stress and wildfires, and other forms of extreme weather and events. One question we’re asking: Are there tipping points in the intensity of extreme events that will cause global food shortages? 

A 2022 research paper published in One Earth underscores the need for quality data to inform food system policy. We’re curious: What are feasible top-down or bottom-up pathways for different sectors to enhance food security? 

We’re learning that climate data isn’t connected to food. We want to investigate: How might artificial intelligence and machine learning be used to help improve early warning systems to identify and inform those who are most vulnerable to food insecurity challenges?

## How We Work

Learning in the open accelerates what we’re able to build together. This platform provides access to iterative prototyping, data, and insights to benefit the entire sector and help conversations go deeper, faster.

We invite the climate-data science community to share ideas and suggestions. Let’s co-create the tools and resources needed for a more sustainable, resilient food system.
